I finally got a work laptop. Finally. It was worth the wait though, I now have a shiny new top of the line gaming laptop with a glowing RGB star on the lid. But oh, they forgot a webcam. 

I was looking forward to this for weeks. Just me and my laptop. I was fantasizing about all the projects I could finally do, all the shitty memes I could make on Photoshop, all the brilliantly written, beautifully designed, post-modern indie video games that I had missed out on. Endless possibilities, all cut off from me because I'd needed my computer for work. 

Anyhow, I installed Ubuntu on my laptop. Go ahead, make fun of me, but Ubuntu just works. I felt the urge the install something wackier but I don't get the appeal anymore. I need something I can just use, without having to worry about Bluetooth drivers bricking my kernel. 

But you know what, unixporn just looks so aesthetic. And I have no self control. I gave in and installed i3wm, and before I knew what was happening, I was looking up color palettes and custom icons for a dedicated workspace that was going to be for "reading". Fortunately, I was able to stop mysellf. But not before I wasted an entire weekend on this. 

I've done this way too often. Organizing and making things prettier instead of actually working. Now that I see how ridiculous this is getting, and how I'll probably end up doing the same thing with this blog, I am going to stop. So apologies if this website looks very cookie-cutter.
