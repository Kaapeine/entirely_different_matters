I finally got a work laptop. Finally. It was worth the wait though, I now have a shiny new laptop with a glowing RGB star on the lid.

I was looking forward to this for weeks. Just me and my laptop, all alone in my house. Just imagine all the projects I can do! All the shitty memes I can make on Photoshop! All the brilliantly written, beautifully designed, post-modern indie video games that I can play! Endless possibilities, all cut off from me because I needed my computer for work. 

Anyhow, I installed Ubuntu on my laptop. Go ahead, make fun of me, but Ubuntu just works. I felt the urge the install something wackier but I'm a big boy now. I need something I can just use, without having to worry about Bluetooth drivers bricking my kernel. 

But you know what, unixporn *is* porn. And I have no self control. I gave into those sexy YouTube thumbnails and installed i3wm. And before I knew what was happening, I was looking up color palettes and custom icons for a dedicated workspace that was going to be for "reading". Fortunately, I was able to stop mysellf. But not before I wasted an entire weekend on this. 

I've done this way too often. Organizing and making things prettier instead of actually working. Now that I see how ridiculous this is getting, and how I'll probably end up doing the same thing with this blog, I am going to stop. So apologies if this website looks very cookie-cutter, I have issues okay?
