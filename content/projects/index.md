Some stuff I've worked on:
- [Anki Card Maker](https://github.com/Kaapeine/AnkiCardMaker): I wanted to improve my Kannada vocabulary, so I built a scraping tool that creates flashcards for Anki.
- [Youtube to Transcript](https://github.com/Kaapeine/yt2transcript): Youtube has some great longform content but I just do not have the time to watch 30min+ long videos. However, I can just skim through it much faster if I had it in text. This script fetches the user-created/auto-generated subtitles and adds punctuation using a great ML-based Python package I found.  
- [URDF Tweaker](https://github.com/Kaapeine/URDF-tweaker): This one is little more obscure. I really hated tuning robot model parameters for Gazebo. Friction, Stiffness and Damping co-efficients to be exact. It was annoying and repetitive. To get around this, I made this tool with a UI that gets rid of a lot of the manual work but isn't the easiest to set up, if I'm being perfectly honest. It helped me then and I've never used it since. I'll take it out if I ever have to make another URDF with lots of parameters to tune.
