I'm Vathsa, a Robotics Engineer by profession and an amateur at everything else. I'm interested in STEM, Internet culture, Music, and Literature, and I wish I had the time for a lot more. I created this mainly with the intentionof documenting my projects, even if I don't get very far with them. A graveyard is cooler than a barren field anyday. 

I'll post all sorts of stuff here, and this is not a resume/portfolio.
