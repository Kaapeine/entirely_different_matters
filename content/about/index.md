I'm Vathsa, a Robotics Engineer by profession and an amateur at everything else. I'm interested in STEM, Internet culture, Music, and Literature, and I wish I had the time for a lot more. I created this mainly with the intention of documenting my projects.

I'll post all sorts of stuff here, and this is not a resume/portfolio. Views expressed here are my own and do not represent my employers' in any way. I hope I got that declaration right because I do not care enough to look it up.
