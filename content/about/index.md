I'm Vathsa, a professional Robotics Engineer and amateur everything else. I'm interested in STEM, Internet culture, Music and Literature, and I wish I had the time for a lot more. I needed a place to express my joyful inner self, and I'm not sure I'm being ironic here. I genuinely believe writing will motivate me to dig deeper into the things I like a lot more than I usually do and hopefully, a little more than what would be healthy.   

I'll post all sorts of stuff here, and this is not just a portfolio because that would be ass. Seriously, resume websites are so kitsch.
